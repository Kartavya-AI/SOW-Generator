# 8. Technical Specifications / Technology Stack (Proposed)

The Contractor proposes to use the following modern and robust technologies for the development of the e-commerce website. Specific framework choices within these categories will be confirmed during the Discovery & Planning phase.

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (e.g., React.js, Vue.js, Angular, or a similar modern JavaScript framework for dynamic user interfaces).

- **Hosting Environment:** Client-provided and configured (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, DigitalOcean, a robust cPanel-based shared hosting, or VPS solution).
- **Payment Gateway:** Stripe, PayPal, or another mutually agreed-upon local payment gateway.
- **Version Control:** Git (managed via platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).

# 9. Assumptions

This Scope of Work is based on the following key assumptions:

- All required content (e.g., textual content for pages, product descriptions, high-quality images, videos) will be provided by the Client in a timely, organized, and digital format as requested by the Contractor.
- The Client will provide prompt and constructive feedback and approvals (within 2-3 business days) at all key project milestones and review points.
- Access to necessary third-party accounts (e.g., payment gateway accounts, hosting control panels, domain registrar access, relevant API keys) will be provided by the Client as and when required by the Contractor.
- The project will not require extensive or complex custom integrations with legacy systems or niche third-party services beyond those explicitly specified as "in-scope."
- The Contractor's team will have unimpeded and reasonable access to relevant Client personnel for clarification, consultation, and collaboration throughout the project lifecycle.
- The estimated cost assumes a standard e-commerce setup with features as defined in Section 4.1, and does not account for extraordinary features, extensive custom development beyond the defined scope, or unforeseen complexities that may arise outside of the Contractor's control.

# 10. Dependencies

The timely and successful completion of this project is critically dependent on:

- The timely provision of all necessary information, content, data, and access credentials by the Client.
- Prompt review and approval of designs, functional specifications, and developed modules by the Client at each stipulated stage.
- The consistent availability and responsiveness of the Client's designated point of contact for decision-making and query resolution.

# 11. Acceptance Criteria

Each deliverable outlined in Section 5 will be considered "accepted" by the Client once it meets the following criteria:

- **Functional Compliance:** The deliverable performs precisely according to the specifications and requirements mutually agreed upon and outlined in Section 4.1 of this SoW.
- **Quality and Stability:** The deliverable is robust, stable, and demonstrably free of critical bugs and errors identified during the Contractor's internal Quality Assurance (QA) phase and the Client's User Acceptance Testing (UAT) phase.
- **Usability:** The interface is intuitive, user-friendly, and provides an efficient experience for its intended audience (both customers and administrators).
- **Responsiveness:** The website displays correctly and maintains full functionality across specified device types (desktop, tablet, and mobile) and major web browsers.
- **Client Review and Formal Approval:** The Client has formally reviewed the deliverable within the agreed-upon review period and has provided written approval, indicating satisfaction with its functionality and quality.

# 12. Revision and Change Management Policy

## 12.1. Design Revisions:

Up to two (2) rounds of major design revisions for mockups and prototypes are included in the scope. A "major revision" constitutes significant structural or stylistic changes requested by the Client affecting more than 25% of the design elements for a given page/component. Minor tweaks and adjustments (less than 25% change) can be made within these rounds. The Client must provide consolidated feedback for each revision round within three (3) business days of receiving the design deliverables. Any requests for additional major design revisions beyond these two (2) rounds will be considered a change to the original scope and will be subject to a formal Change Order.

## 12.2. Development Revisions:

Bug fixes identified during the Contractor's internal Quality Assurance (QA) process and the Client's User Acceptance Testing (UAT) phase that are directly attributable to the Contractor's development work, and which cause the deliverable to not meet the agreed-upon specifications, are included. One (1) round of minor functional adjustments based on Client feedback after core development completion (Phases 3 & 4) is also included. These minor adjustments should not introduce new features or significantly alter the defined functionality.

## 12.3. Change Order Process:

Any request for work or modifications deemed outside the defined scope of this SoW, including additional features, significant changes to approved designs/functionalities, or revisions exceeding the included rounds, must be submitted by the requesting party in writing (a "Change Request"). The Contractor will review the Change Request and, within five (5) business days, provide a formal Change Order proposal detailing the requested changes, their impact on the project cost, revised timeline, and affected deliverables. Work on the change will commence only after mutual written agreement and formal approval (via signature or confirmed email) by authorized representatives of both parties. Delay in Client approval of Change Orders may impact the overall project timeline.

# Estimated Budget Validation

The estimated budget for the E-commerce Website Development project is validated at **$25,000 - $45,000 USD**.

## Justification:

The project scope outlines a custom-built e-commerce website with a comprehensive set of standard features, including:

- A functional front-end and back-end.
- Product catalog management.
- Shopping cart and checkout.
- Secure payment gateway integration.
- User account management.
- An admin panel for various operations.
- Responsive design.
- Basic SEO setup.
- Deployment, quality assurance, initial content upload, and user training.

The project has a defined timeline of approximately 5.5 months (January 15, 2025, to June 29, 2025).

Web data for "average cost custom e-commerce website development in 2025" supports the provided budget range:

- Several sources indicate that custom e-commerce website development costs can range from **$10,000 to over $100,000**, with many falling into the **$20,000 - $50,000+** bracket for projects of small to medium complexity.
- Specifically, "Mid-sized eCommerce sites" are often quoted in the range of **$25,000 – $100,000+**, which directly aligns with the lower bound of the given estimate.
- The complexity implied by a 5.5-month development cycle involving multiple phases (discovery, design, backend/frontend development, payment integration, testing, deployment, and initial support) suggests a significant investment beyond basic template-based solutions.

Considering the detailed deliverables and the approximately 5.5-month timeline for a custom e-commerce solution in the 2025 market, the proposed budget range of $25,000 to $45,000 USD is a realistic and well-justified estimate for a small to medium complexity project.
